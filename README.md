# 📊 Automatic EDA Web App

<!-- ![AutoEDA Logo](insert your logo URL here) -->

## 🔥 Overview
AutoEDA is an open-source Python application designed to streamline the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data scientists, analysts, and anyone working with data. EDA is a crucial step in understanding your dataset, finding patterns, and preparing data for further analysis. AutoEDA simplifies this process by providing an interactive web-based platform to explore, visualize, and preprocess your data effortlessly.

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 Upload CSV files for analysis
- 📊 Display dataset preview & summary statistics
- 📈 Generate interactive visualizations
- 🔍 Detect and visualize missing values
- 📉 Show correlation heatmaps
- 🧹 Data cleaning and transformation recommendations
- 📌 Supports various data types

This is the home screen of the web application. From here, you can upload any dataset you want and perform Exploratory Data Analysis right through the web.


## Why AutoEDA?

- Efficiency: AutoEDA automates routine EDA tasks, saving you time and effort.

- Interactivity: Visualize your data interactively to gain insights quickly.

- User-Friendly: No coding required. All tasks can be performed using the user-friendly web interface.

## Current Progress

**Dataset Overview:** Users can load and preview their datasets, access basic dataset statistics, and check for missing data.

**Data Exploration and Visualization:** Users can explore numerical and categorical features, create histograms, scatter plots, and other visualizations.

**Data Preprocessing**: Users can now perform data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables,feature scaling, identifying and handling outliers and more, directly from the web interface. This streamlines the data preparation process and saves time.
## Roadmap

I am actively working on enhancing and expanding the data preprocessing feature, as well as adding more features to the application. My goal is to continually improve the user experience and provide a comprehensive set of tools for data analysis and preprocessing. I'm dedicated to making the project even more powerful and user-friendly, so stay tuned for exciting updates and improvements! Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated as they help shape the future of this project.
